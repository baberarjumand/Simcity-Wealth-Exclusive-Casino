I have tweaked parkerwyoung's Casino Overhaul Mod to now have wealth-exclusive casinos.
You can now build a city which gets only high wealth or medium wealth tourists.
I tested this mod with the Elegant Casino (High Wealth Only) and have attached screens as proof.
Note that if you place a landmark, this mod will not work and you will get other wealth tourists.
To use this mod as is intended, DO NOT PLACE ANY LANDMARKS.

Installation:

	1. Place "Mod-Nexus91110-WealthExclusiveCasinos.package" in ...SimCity\SimCityUserData\Packages
	2. Place the provided "SimCity-Scripts_287520926.package" in ...SimCity\SimCityUserData\Packages
	3. Place "Mod-Parker-CasinoPlopExtension-v1.0" in ...\SimCity\SimCityData

I have written below what changes I have made to parkerwyoung's Casino Overhaul mod.
I have also made some changes to the number of signs you can place for some casinos.
This mod has all the features of parkerwyoung's Casino Overhaul Mod.
Now you can bring in only medium wealth or high wealth or low wealth tourists.

Have fun creating the ultimate rich people resort !!!
