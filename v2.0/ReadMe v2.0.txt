==========================================================================================

In v1.0 of this mod, if you would use the casino modules, other wealth tourists would start coming to your city thus negating the purpose of this mode.
After significant changes, this problem has been fixed. You can now use any module on any casino without attracting other wealth tourists.
For example, I made the SciFi Casino exclusive to low-wealth tourists. But if I popped the tower rooms to make my city prettier, mid-wealth tourists would start coming to the city.

With v2.0, this problem has been addressed and solved. The modules which are no longer required for a specific wealth, their costs have been lowered and they can still serve as decoration buildings to the casino. Who wants a Roman Casino without a Concert Hall right.

In addition to this issue, other improvements and tweaks have been made. Some capacities have been doubled along with their costs, more profits but greater starting costs. Nevertheless, an enhanced experience is guaranteed.

I have also increased the number of signs in all casinos to 10.

For a detailed list of the changes made to Parker's Casino Overhaul mod, please see the included PDF file.
The changes I have made are highlighted yellow in colour.

As advised before in my previous mod, to make wealth-exclusive cities do not pop landmarks in the city.
